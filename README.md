Sinclair Community College

CIS 1111 - Intro to Problem Solving and Computer Programming:
Introduction to problem-solving techniques used in programming. Students learn to use tools such as flowcharts and pseudocode to plan solutions. Using the C++ programming language, students will design, code, and test programs using sequence, selection, iteration, functions, and arrays.

University of Alabama

CS100 - CS 1 for Majors:
A first course in programming for students majoring in computer science. Language concepts include primitives, variables, sequences, function, selection, iteration and recursion. Software engineering concepts include testing and debugging. System concepts include directories, paths, files, and text editing.

CS 101 - CS 2 for Majors:
A second course in programming for students majoring in computer science. Using a high-level language, students use object-oriented practices to study fundamental data structures and algorithms. Issues such as computability, problem complexity and algorithm analysis, efficient searching and sorting, data structures, and the object-oriented programming paradigm are introduced and explained. Computing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course.
