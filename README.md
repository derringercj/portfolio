Sinclair Community College

CIS 1111 - Intro to Problem Solving and Computer Programming:
Introduction to problem-solving techniques used in programming. Students learn to use tools such as flowcharts and pseudocode to plan solutions. Using the C++ programming language, students will design, code, and test programs using sequence, selection, iteration, functions, and arrays.

University of Alabama

CS100 - CS 1 for Majors:
A first course in programming for students majoring in computer science. Language concepts include primitives, variables, sequences, function, selection, iteration and recursion. Software engineering concepts include testing and debugging. System concepts include directories, paths, files, and text editing.

CS 101 - CS 2 for Majors:
A second course in programming for students majoring in computer science. Using a high-level language, students use object-oriented practices to study fundamental data structures and algorithms. Issues such as computability, problem complexity and algorithm analysis, efficient searching and sorting, data structures, and the object-oriented programming paradigm are introduced and explained. Computing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course.

CS 200 - Software Engineering:
Introduction to software engineering: the software crisis, program life cycle, software systems analysis techniques, software modeling, theory and practice of design, program testing methodologies, programmer team organization, and program verification and synthesis. Computing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course.

CS 201 - Data Structures and Algorithms:
Data structures including balanced search trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs. Algorithm design techniques including divide-and-conquer, greedy method, and dynamic programming. Emphasis on problem solving, design, analysis, and reasoning about data structures and algorithms. Computing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course.

CS 300 - Operating Systems:
Study of basic operating system concepts with an emphasis on memory, processor, device, and information management.

CS 301 - Database Management Systems:
Constituent parts of database management (design, creation, and manipulation of databases), including the conceptual and relational data models, SQL, normalization and security. Writing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course. A student who does not write with the skill normally required of an upper-division student will not earn a passing grade, no matter how well the student performs in other areas of the course.

CS 503 - Programming Languages:
This course provides a graduate level presentation of Programming Languages. Formal student of programming language specification, analysis, implementation, and run-time support structures; organization of programming languages with emphasis on language constructs and mechanisms; and study of non-programming paradigms.

CS 570 - Computer Algorithms:
This course provides a graduate level presentation of Introduction to Computer Algorithms. Construction of efficient algorithms for computer implementation.
